# Weathery
Weathery is an easy and fast way to retrieve and visualize the current weather and temperature of a certain city.
This is a tiny project based on vanilla javascript for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end in order to get more comfortable with this framework.

Live demo: http://weathery-app.herokuapp.com/

The live demo does not work due to the low quota limit for google maps api (used to autocomplete the input of the city and retrieve the coordinates of the given location).
